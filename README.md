# OpentableSorter
filter down options from Open Table using various criteria

This app allows the user to paste in the URL of a list of brunch options from Opentable.com.
The user can then narrow the list by the neighborhood, type of cuisine, and whether there are unlimited beverages.
The program then returns a simple table of options.

Currently, the program can only handle certain types of promotional pages from OpenTable.
It might be able to do more than Sunday Brunch, but that has not been tested.
